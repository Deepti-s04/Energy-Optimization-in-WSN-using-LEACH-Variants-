# 📡 Energy Optimization in WSN using LEACH Variants 🌿

**_Project from my 5th Semester at Bennett University!_** 🎓

## 📖 Overview  
In this research project, I explored how to improve **energy efficiency in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)** using different **LEACH protocol variants**.  
The protocols were simulated and tested on three different platforms:  
- **Cooja (Contiki OS)** — for real-world node-level testing  
- **NS2** — for basic, smaller simulations  
- **NS3** — for large-scale, scalable network simulations  

## 🔍 What I Did  
- Simulated various **LEACH-based protocols** to compare their energy consumption and efficiency.
- Analyzed **graphs, tables, and simulation results** from all three simulators.
- Studied how different simulators behave in realistic and scalable environments.

## 📊 Key Takeaways  
- **NS3** performed better for large networks with scalable simulations.  
- **NS2** was quick and simple for basic testing.  
- **Cooja** gave real-world advantages for node-level, energy-focused simulations.

## 🚀 Future Scope  
I’m planning to extend this work by:  
- Exploring **fuzzy logic-based LEACH variants**  
- Integrating **energy harvesting models** for greener and smarter WSNs.

## 📑 Research Paper  
A detailed **research paper** for this project is **also ready** — I haven't uploaded it here yet but it's in the works and will be added soon! 📄✨
